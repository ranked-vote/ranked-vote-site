            <h2>Honest Approval Set</h2>
            
            <p>Another voting system is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">Approval Voting</a>, which involves
            indicating one or more candidates you approve of without ranking them. The candidate with the most voters who approve of them wins.
            It is impossible to know how voters would vote on an approval ballot based on their ranked ballot, but two reasonable assumptions
            we can narrow down the set of possibe approval ballots. With these possible approval ballots, we
            can determine which candidates would have had a chance of winning under an approval voting system.
            </p>

            <p>The assumptions we make are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Every voter who ranked at least one candidate would have voted for at least one candidate in an approval vote.</li>
                <li>Every voterâ€™s approval votes would be consistent with their ranked ballot, that is, they would not vote for a candidate unless
                    they also voted for every candidate who appeared above that candidate on their ranked ballot.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The tables below show the maximum votes each candidate could get in an approval system without breaking these assumptions. They are broken
                up into two groups: candidates who conceivably could have won, and candidates that could not have.
